                                Midway through the sprint we realized that our second user story that was about creating custom output styles had a very low priority to the user so we moved it out of the current sprint. We then moved in a user story with the next highest priority, split it into tasks and assigned tasks to each of us. We also realized we did not allocate any time for getting stuff ready for the deliverable so the remaining time was assigned to preparing the deliverable.<br><br>
                                Near the end of the sprint we determined that we were not making any progress on our first user story about linking a document from a private library to a group library. We had a hard time figuring out how to implement it, and we did not allocate enough time to do so. So we decided it would be better to take time out of the next sprint and finish it then, so we could complete the remaining user story which we had a better idea of what to do. We also decided that we would increase the cost of the second user story so we would have more time to research and implement the second user story.<br><br>
                                We were not able to accomplish very much this sprint because we spent too much time deciding on a direction for the rest of the sprint . In addition we attempted to implement the hardest user stories knowing the little experience the team has with the system. That is why we feel that putting the first user story in the next sprint will be beneficial to actually getting that user story to work.<br><br>
                                Currently, we have built a pop out window with prompt to enter a reference field name and its corresponding field value. The window also contain an add button and delete button which will eventually link to our backend database calls. Locally, we have a working table made for the custom field but it is not committed at the moment to ensure that it does not crash current data system. The database took a long time to implement due to the fact that we did not realize that the zotero source database have security built-ins that stop database adjustment on table create events. Therefore, various database adjustments had to be made.<br><br>

                            <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
                            <h4 style="text-align: left">
                                The sudden decision to move everything from source code to plugin created some complications and demand for extra time. We created a directory called “AnyaPlsPlugin” that contains all our implementations. This is the result of our agreement that adding to the source code makes Zotero less open source friendly and it also makes our features more maintainable and more able to add more features. However, this resulted in us needing to add an extra database to store our plugin data that cannot make foreign key references and therefore involves the complication of first querying from the original Zotero database to get reference.<br><br>
                                In addition, our realization that our user story would also need the ability to delete and modify current field required us to create another batch of tasks that provide support for delete and modification. We are aware that our current design is not very user-friendly, but we will strive to improve UX on further sprints.<br><br>
                                One major problem that caused us to make a major change was the issue of NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE that we could not solve. After a data input, we were unable to close the parent instance which causes a failure in attempting to create a second custom field. To solve the problem in the front-end, we changed from home page push-button for prompt to right-clicking reference object for custom field editing.<br><br>
                                Second major issue that we are dealing with as of the moment involves printing out the custom fields in the existing “Info” tab in the existing Zotero front-end. Since appending to original XUL document is not possible as a plugin, we are attempting to overwrite the Javascript that renders the queries and listing out of the fields and approach from that direction.<br><br>

                            <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
                            <h4 style="text-align: left">
                                This week’s sprint consists of an additional new feature that allows users to customize the output of their citation. Users can select an item and right click the option of “add custom citation” to generate a customized citation format. The custom citation is evoked by right-clicking a reference item and selecting “Custom Bibliography.” From the drop-down, users can select any number of fields they need and wherever they need to produce the citation they want. Each field is initially denoted by a &(field_name_here) then can be converted to the field value by clicking “Fill in Bibliography.” Afterwards, users can customize the format as they can normally do in a common text editor, such as insertion of a new line, comma, etc. Once they are satisfied with the new format, users can click “Save” to save the new citation format to their local database. Once they come back to use Zotero again, they can simply click “Load” to retrieve the citation that they were working on.<br><br>
                                The second introduced feature is batch tag editing. This feature is complete with the ability to batch add, rename, and delete existing tags. The feature was over-estimated due to the fact that we did not have an idea on how the existing Zotero manage their tags. However, after realizing the simplicity of their API. We used a lot of their code to infuse in our tag management implementation, and thus the sudden drop in our burnt-down chart. In regards to batch adding, users can multi-select different items which they want to add the tag to. And in regards to batch editing, users can multi-select the choices of tags by holding down the control button and pick out the tags that the user chooses to rename. However, one inconvenience involves needing to close the tag management window in order to see the updated change.<br><br>
                                In addition to the new feature, another prime focus on this sprint is the implementation of various UX enhancement on our previous features.<br><br>
                                Firstly, users can now search custom fields in the existing search bar. By clicking the checkbox to enable custom field search, users can type in entries of custom fields then the list of references with associated custom fields will filter according to the search input.<br><br>
                                Secondly, users can now see their custom fields being shown on the “Info” tab. Previously, users had to right click a reference object to display current fields. That option still exist but it is definitely clearer to users when they browse through their items.<br><br>
                                Third of all, when users want to manage their custom fields in the customizing window, they would have had a hard time seeing which field pertains to their current item and which does not. However, with the current organization, the problem is solved. Users can now clearly distinguish between current items’ fields and other items’ fields.<br><br>
                                There were a few issues encountered during this sprint that took a long time to fix. First of all, searching for custom fields created issues in filtering the items. On clicking the checkbox to filter by custom field, searching is enabled and searches were successful, but afterwards unclicking to unfilter items did not work. In addition, there are issues on performing searches in full screen. Secondly, adding display of custom field to the “Info” tab had issues on full screen as well. You can see custom field disappearing when altering the screen mode. In addition, one minor issue is that there is a small lag upon browsing items to display the custom field in the “Info” tab.<br><br>
                                In regards to branching, the relation below shows new corresponding additions:<br><br>
